# FINAL-PROJECT-GEEKSHUBS

CSS NINTENDO SWITCH:

This is my first project for week 1 of geekshubs academy. The task is to produce a CSS image of a controller of our choice.

This was my first time using html and css to create a project. The controller that I chose for this task was the Nintendo Switch.

I built the controller in three stages using CSS; firstly, I made the rectangular shape divided into distinct sections with different colours. 

The next task was to add the buttons (d-pad, joystick shoulder buttons, home and control buttons).

Finally, I mounted an image in the middle. I tried to add interativity by using the 'hover' function on the left d-pad when the cursor is placed over it. 

Overall the results were mixed in my opinion; whilst I am relatively happy with it aesthetically, I would like to improve upon the interactivity in the future - possibly

by using a GIF image instead of a static image and/or improving and extending my use of the hover function.
